                  Csmith For OpenMP Extensions --- a random generator of C programs with OpenMP extensions.
                  This branch contains documentation for Csmith which cannot be found in (Original Csmith)
                  https://github.com/csmith-project/csmith.
                  
                  This branch was created with aim of merging OPenMP extensions to Csmith as a GSoC project idea forGCC.
                  You can find commits and command line options implemented using ./csmith --help 
                  
                  A proposal related to some OpenMP extensions which are possible to implement in Csmith,
                  time for each extension, learning resources and challenges can be found :

                  I Wrote a blog,Using TSan(ThreadSanitizer) find data races while implementing these extensions 
                  and suppressing false positives from TSan.

                  If you wish to further implement more extensions to the branch you are welcome to start exploring it.
                  Happy Hacking!!!
